# Amazon-Review-Summarizer

This Python script utilizes Selenium for web scraping to collect Amazon product reviews and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for natural language processing to summarize the gathered reviews. The process involves fetching reviews from multiple pages of a specified product on Amazon and then summarizing the common sentiments including complaints.

## Installation
